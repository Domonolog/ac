    <h2>Why does my business need an Accessibility Statement?</h2>
    <p>Accessibility statements exist to show site visitors the current status of your website’s accessibility as well as any accessibility-related efforts your business is working on right now.</p>
    <p>All new websites are required to meet accessibility standards and publish an accessibility statement, namely websites offering information or services to the public sector.</p>
    <p>Accessibility statements help your users to understand the extent to which your site, app, products, and services are accessible. Where barriers or violations exist, the statement must inform users of alternative routes to access.</p>
    <p>This information is especially useful to site visitors with disabilities who may need specific accommodations. Your statement should also share where visitors can get more information or leave feedback if they encounter any accessibility barriers or limitations, including how to contact the website owner if they encounter any accessibility violations.</p>
    <p>Newly published websites must have already published an accessibility statement by September 2019, while older websites have had until January 1, 2020 to comply.</p>
